  <h1>LAKSHMI NARASIMHA</h1>
</center>
<hr>

<p>In an alternate iteration of the legend of Narasimha, after he slays Hiranyakashipu, his fury is still unabated. The deity is enraged that his virtuous devotee, Prahlada, is traumatised by the violent deeds of his own father. Despite the fact that the devas sing his praises and extol his glories, he remains unpacified. The devas proceed to pray to Lakshmi, who appears before her consort. She soothes Narasimha, assuring him that both his devotee and the world had been saved. Hearing his wife's words, the deity is pacified, and his appearance also becomes more benign.</p>
